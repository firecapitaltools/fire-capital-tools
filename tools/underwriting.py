"""
FIRE Capital Tools - Underwriting (beta).

A full pro forma: a rent roll builds effective gross income, an itemized
expense set builds operating expenses, and the resulting NOI series runs
through the same returns engine Deal Analyzer uses, with a two-variable
sensitivity grid over the top.

Where this sits between the existing tools:

    Deal Dive -> Financials   what a deal's figures ARE (a record)
    Deal Analyzer             what ONE NOI number returns (a screen)
    Underwriting              where that NOI comes from (a model)

The rule of thumb offered to the user is "do you already know the NOI, or
do you need to build it?".

Reuse rather than reimplementation, deliberately:
  * returns          deal_analyzer_math.analyze_noi_series -- the same
                     engine, so the two tools can never disagree about the
                     same deal, and every sensitivity cell is computed by it
  * expenses         scorecard_pro PnLParser + KPICalculator.category_breakdown
  * rent roll        tools/underwriting_rentroll (new: nothing existing
                     returns per-unit data)
  * uploads          the shared UPLOAD_FOLDER, already volume-safe

Deal-linked is the primary mode: underwriting something means having its
T12 and rent roll, which means it is real enough to be in Deal Dive.
Standalone is supported for a broker package that arrives first, and then
requires a property_label.
