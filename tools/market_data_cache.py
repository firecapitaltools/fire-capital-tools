FIRE Capital Tools - Market data cache.

Backs tools/market_data_service.py. Kept in its own module (rather than
folded into the service file) for the same reason scorecard_history.py and
deal_dive_db.py are separate from their blueprints -- a persistence layer
with no dependency on any tool's own route/blueprint code, so it stays
independently reusable (this cache and the service in front of it are
built standalone specifically so a future "Rent Comps" tool can reuse them
without redoing this work).

Same connection/schema-init pattern as every other SQLite module in this
app: env-var-overridable path with a local fallback, fresh connection per
call, idempotent CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS on every connect.

The database path is controlled by MARKET_DATA_DB_PATH (falls back to a
local file at the repo root for development).

# Details call this service makes requests rating, user_ratings_total, and

# category, which Google's own Legacy API docs confirm is billed on top of
# the base request, and third-party pricing trackers place at the
# Enterprise tier (~1,000 free events/month, the smallest allowance of the
# three tiers) since Google's own pages don't publish the exact number in
# one place. Given that real uncertainty -- and given the point of this
# cap is to never repeat the surprise-charge experience that already
# happened once -- the threshold below is set to roughly 10% of that
# researched (not confirmed) ~1,000/month figure, a much larger safety

#     cached row   '19 bay vista drive mill valley ca 94941'      -> MISS
#
# That is a paid RentCast call spent on data already held, against a
# 50/month budget.
#
# THIS IS NOT THE STREET-SUFFIX CASE AND THE DIFFERENCE IS THE WHOLE POINT
#
# Dropping street types was ruled out and STAYS ruled out: `100 Main St`,
# `100 Main Ave` and `100 Main Blvd` all collapse to `100 main`, they
# coexist in real cities, and serving one street's comps for another is
# far worse than a wasted call. That rule was then applied to the zip by
# association, which is where it was overbroad -- the two cases differ on
# both counts that matter:
#
#   COLLISION   Dropping a suffix merges addresses that DIFFER. Truncating
#               a +4 merges only inputs identical in address, city, state
#               and all five zip digits -- which is one address. The +4
#               carries nothing the address line does not: a unit lives in
#               the address line, so two units differ there and their keys
#               still differ. Verified against six adversarial pairs in
#               tests, including all three Main St/Ave/Blvd forms.
#
#   ORPHANING   Changing the key function strands every existing row under
#               the old function, so every lookup misses and triggers a
#               fresh paid call. Measured before this change: ZERO of the
#               twelve cached rows carries a ZIP+4, and market_data_cache
#               is the only table in /data holding an address_key at all.
#               So this orphans nothing. It merges exactly one key -- deal
#               1's -- onto the row it should have been hitting all along.
#
# Nothing else is touched. No suffix handling, no punctuation stripping,
# no city or state rewriting. Those need a human looking at the result
# (see docs/address-normalize-at-entry.md); this one does not, because
# there is no judgement in it.
