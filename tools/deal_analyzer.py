FIRE Capital Tools - Quick Deal Analyzer (beta).

One question: given a NOI and a cap rate, what should this property be
worth?

    Gross Potential Income - Vacancy & Credit Loss + Other Income
      = EGI - Operating Expenses = NOI / Cap Rate = Implied Price

Three ways to arrive at the NOI, each labelled on screen so the reader
knows what the price is built on:

  * Build-up      the income and expense lines above      "Estimated"
  * Direct entry  a NOI figure typed straight in          "Entered"
  * T12 upload    twelve months of actuals, parsed        "Actuals — from T12"

Two modes, one page, mirroring tools/rent_comps.py:
  * Standalone -- screening a lead that isn't in Deal Dive yet.
  * Deal-linked -- arrived at with ?deal_id=N, prefilled from that deal.

Deal-linked inputs are not locked. The whole point is "what if the NOI
were lower / the cap rate higher", so every prefilled value stays
editable, and nothing entered here writes back to the deal.

WHAT THIS TOOL USED TO BE

Until this rewrite this page was a levered-returns model: purchase price
in, cap rate / cash-on-cash / DSCR / IRR / equity multiple / annual cash
flows out. That model is not deleted -- it lives in
tools/deal_analyzer_math.py, unchanged and still fully tested, and is
exercised through Underwriting, which does the same job far more
thoroughly from a real rent roll and itemized expenses. What changed is
the direction of this page: price in / returns out became NOI in / price
out. The two tools are now separated by the question they answer rather
than by how much typing they need.

Stateless by design: no database, no saved scenarios, and an uploaded
T12 is parsed and discarded rather than stored. Results are a pure
function of the submitted inputs (tools/quick_analyzer_math.py), so
there is nothing to persist that could not be recomputed.
