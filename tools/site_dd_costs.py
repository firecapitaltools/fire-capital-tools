FIRE Capital Tools - Site DD cost provenance.

Where a repair estimate came from, and the mapping from findings to
Underwriting's capex budget. Pure: no Flask, no database, no I/O.

THREE SOURCES, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM EXISTS YET

  reference   from a cost table. NOTHING WRITES THIS. The reference
              costs themselves are still gated on the decision between
              Michelle's numbers, RSMeans, and disclaimed placeholders --
              and shipping a column that a later branch fills is very
              different from shipping numbers nobody has agreed to.
  manual      an inspector typed it, standing in the room. The only
              source this branch produces.
  none        no estimate. The default, and not a failure state: most
              findings never need a number.

The column exists now, before anything fills it, for the same reason the
capex source/source_ref hook was built before Site DD did: a provenance
column added after the fact cannot describe the rows already written.
Every row this branch writes says 'manual' truthfully, and when reference
costs land they will not have to guess which of the existing estimates
came from a person.

WHY A MANUAL ESTIMATE IS LABELLED EVERY TIME IT IS SHOWN

An inspector's guess at a water heater and a figure from a cost database
look identical once they are both a number in a column. One is a
tradesman's judgement from ten feet away; the other is a priced
line item. Presenting them the same way would let the first quietly
acquire the authority of the second, which is exactly the failure the
disclaimer discipline in tools/deal_readiness_defaults.py exists to
prevent -- so the same rule applies here, enforced by a test.

    ── A HALF THAT SHIPPED ALONE. DO NOT WIRE THIS AS IT STANDS. ────────

    NOTHING CALLS THIS. It is the Site DD -> Underwriting hand-off, built
    and tested in c39bbce, whose other half -- the route or button that
    would turn an assessment into underwriting capex lines -- was never
    written. `underwriting_capex.SOURCE_SITE_DD` is the matching reserved
    value, also written by nothing.

    It is kept rather than deleted because the design in it is real: the
    SCOPE_MAP translation below (underwriting_capex_lines accepts only
    exterior|interior and silently rewrites anything else), and the
    source_ref back-link to the originating finding. Both would have to
    be rediscovered.

    **It has drifted three correctness fixes behind
    site_dd_capex_export.build_lines(), and wiring it would put a known
    bug into equity and IRR.** Measured on identical findings:

      1. RATES. A $5.75 PER SQUARE FOOT repaint becomes quantity=1 and
         line_total() multiplies it to $5.75. This is exactly the bug
         b613a76 fixed in the export -- seven of thirty-six researched
         figures are rates and they are the expensive ones. build_lines()
         refuses to total a rate without a measured quantity.
      2. FIRST COST WINS. Two toilets at $450 and $600 in one room become
         "Toilet x2 @ $450"; $300 leaves the budget without a trace.
         build_lines() puts cost in the grouping key so they stay apart.
      3. NO DETAIL IN THE KEY. A missing smoke alarm and one needing
         replacement merge into one line. Closed in build_lines() by
         8b8ba17; still open here.

    So the shape when the hand-off is finally wired is NOT "call this
    function". It is: **map build_lines()' output onto
    underwriting_capex_lines**, keeping only the scope translation and
    the source_ref from here. One grouping, two destinations. Two
    independent groupings of the same findings is how these two drifted
    apart three times already.

    Full evidence in docs/site-dd-to-capex-lines.md.
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Grouped by (assessment scope, item), because quantity is the INSTANCE
    COUNT: two sinks needing replacement are one budget line of quantity
    2, not two lines that a reader has to add up.

    THE LABEL IS NOT JUST instance_label

    Phase 1 wrote "label <- instance label", which is right only for a
    freeform item. A curated bank pick leaves instance_label NULL, so
    taken literally every fireplace would arrive in the budget as
    "Item 1". The label falls back to the catalogue name, and a typed
    name wins over it when there is one.

    source_ref carries the FIRST finding's id. The column is TEXT and
    holds one reference, so a grouped line points at the row a reader
    should open to see the photographs -- not at all of them.
