FIRE Capital Tools - Deal Analyzer calculations.

Every number Deal Analyzer shows is produced here. Deliberately pure: no
Flask, no request context, no I/O, no globals -- inputs in, a result dict
out -- so the formulas can be unit-tested directly (tests/
test_deal_analyzer_math.py) rather than only through an HTTP round-trip.
Same standalone principle as tools/market_data_service.py.

Scope is a levered-returns read on *one* set of assumptions: a single
blended NOI growth rate, a single amortizing loan held to sale, and a cap-
rate exit. No unit-level rent roll, no itemized expenses, no refinance, no
sensitivity tables -- those belong in the Underwriting tool.

Interest-only periods live here now, because the amortization arithmetic
they change has always lived here and Underwriting borrows it. They are
not exposed by Deal Analyzer: that tool sets no io_years, the parameter
defaults to absent, and the debt-service series collapses to the level
payment it always was. A test asserts Deal Analyzer's route never sets
the field, and another asserts the no-IO result is unchanged key by key.

Two conventions worth stating because reasonable models differ:

  * Exit value uses the *forward* NOI (year H+1), which is what a buyer at
    the end of year H would be capitalizing. Using year H's NOI instead
    understates the exit by one year of growth.
  * Cash flows are annual and end-of-year. Debt service is computed from a
    monthly amortization schedule and then annualized, because a monthly
    payment on a 30-year note is not simply the annual-rate equivalent.

Nothing here returns NaN or infinity. Anything that cannot be computed --
DSCR with no debt, an IRR with no sign change -- comes back as None with a
companion reason string, so the caller renders an em dash and an
explanation rather than "nan".

    has had. Everything before it was operating cash flow and a terminal
    sale, so the shape is new even though every piece of arithmetic it
    uses already existed.

    THE ORDER, WHICH IS MICHELLE'S AND NOT AN INVENTION

        new loan
          - payoff of the old loan       (IO-aware, at refi_year * 12)
          - refinance costs              (THIRD-PARTY ONLY: title,
                                          appraisal, legal, recording)
          - bank loan fee                (1% of the new loan)
          - GP capital transaction fee   (1% of the new loan)
          = what reaches the investors

    Preferred return is deliberately absent from that list. It is not
    paid at the event; it keeps accruing afterwards on whatever capital
    is still unreturned, which is the whole point of returning capital
    early.

    WHAT refi_costs_pct MEANS, WHICH CHANGED

    It used to mean "points and closing" -- and a point IS lender
    origination, priced as a percentage of loan size. So when the bank's
    loan fee was added as its own input, the bank's point was being
    charged twice: once inside refi_costs and once as refi_bank_fee_pct.
    On Michelle's real 1%/1%/1% that was $52,000 of double-count, worth
    0.33 of an IRR point.

    She chose to split them: "let's go with option (b) and split them out
    so the bank's fees are a separate line item."

    So refi_costs_pct is now THIRD-PARTY CLOSING COSTS ONLY -- title,
    appraisal, legal, recording -- and carries no origination. The
    lender's point lives in refi_bank_fee_pct where she can see it. The
    two are disjoint by definition, and the definition is stated in three
    places that must move together: here, the payout order above, and the
    form label with its help text.

    THE ACQUISITION SIDE NOW AGREES, AND THAT WAS AN OPEN QUESTION

    This paragraph used to record an inconsistency: acquisition folded
    origination into DEFAULT_ACQUISITION_COST_CATEGORIES as one of nine
    line items, the opposite convention from here, flagged rather than
    fixed because Michelle had been asked about the refinance and not
    about acquisition.

    She was then asked: "Yes, please split the lender's origination fee
    out of the acquisition costs for consistency." So the categories are
    eight third-party items, and the lender's point is `loan_fee_pct` --
    the acquisition-side twin of `refi_bank_fee_pct`, charged on the loan
    rather than the price, because that is what a point is.

    Both sides of the model now mean the same thing by "costs": third
    party only, with the lender's fee visible on its own line.

    THE FEE BASE IS SETTLED, AND IT IS THE GROSS NEW LOAN

    This was an open question and is now answered. Michelle: "the 1% is
    taken from the new loan amount. For example, the $5.2M refi loan
    amount would be $52K in the capital transaction fee. There is also a
    standard 1% loan fee that the bank takes which would also be deducted
    from the refi loan amount."

    So BOTH fees are a share of the gross new loan, not of the excess
    pool. The earlier reading -- fee on the excess, forced by the fee's
    position in the payout order -- was wrong, and on the test fixture it
    was wrong by $7,672.83 against $52,000.

    The two fees are separate and additive: the bank's loan fee is a cost
    of borrowing and the capital transaction fee is the GP's compensation
    for the transaction. Neither is a substitute for the other.

    WHERE THE BANK FEE SITS, WHICH IS A READING AND NOT A QUOTE

    She said the bank fee is "deducted from the refi loan amount" but did
    not say where it falls relative to refi_costs or the GP fee. Because
    all three are computed on the gross new loan rather than on each
    other's remainders, ORDER DOES NOT CHANGE ANY NUMBER HERE -- the
    arithmetic is commutative and the investor proceeds are identical
    whichever sequence is used. It is written above payoff-then-costs-
    then-bank-then-GP because that is the order money actually leaves a
    closing table. If a future change ever makes one fee a share of
    another's remainder, this stops being cosmetic and must be confirmed.

    A cash-in refinance -- new loan smaller than the payoff -- is refused
    rather than modelled as a negative distribution.
