FIRE Capital Tools - Quick Deal Analyzer T12 extraction.

Turns a parsed T12 into the five totals the valuation form needs:
gross potential income, vacancy loss, other income, operating expenses
and NOI. Nothing else.

WHY THIS IS NOT UNDERWRITING'S T12 IMPORT

Underwriting's upload_t12() runs KPICalculator.category_breakdown() to
produce an editable, itemized expense set: depth-aware leaf detection so
a tree-format P&L is not double-counted, GL codes, per-line growth rates,
and capex/debt-service exclusion defaults. All of that exists to support
a line-by-line model.

This tool has no line items. It needs five numbers. So it uses
KPICalculator.calculate() -- which already computes monthly income,
expenses and NOI -- and sums twelve months. No category breakdown, no
leaf detection, no exclusion defaults, nothing editable. Underwriting's
import is untouched and keeps its own behaviour.

WHY THE DEDUCTION LINE IS "VACANCY & CREDIT LOSS", NOT "VACANCY"

The obvious implementation reads code 4220 (Vacancy Loss) and calls it
vacancy. On Eagle Rock's real T12 that is wrong by $115,439: the rent
deductions between Gross Potential Rent (4110) and Net Rental Income
(4000) are vacancy AND loss-to-lease, bad debt, concessions, discounts
and move-in credits. Reading only 4220 produced a build-up whose NOI was
$112,546 higher than the NOI the same file reports -- a statement that
does not tie, which is the one thing a statement must do.

So the deduction is taken as the whole distance from 4110 to 4000, and
the field is labelled for what it actually contains. Likewise "other
income" is the distance from Net Rental Income to total income, which
picks up the income fallback codes KPICalculator counts (Eagle Rock has
$2,893.67 of them) rather than code 4300 alone.

Every figure is therefore derived from the two totals KPICalculator
itself computes -- income and expenses -- so this module cannot disagree
with Scorecard Pro about what the file says. reconcile() asserts that
before returning: the build-up must reproduce the reported NOI, or
nothing is returned at all.

Pure apart from the parser it is handed: no Flask, no request context,
no filesystem beyond the path the caller already validated.
