FIRE Capital Tools - Underwriting calculations.

Builds a NOI series from a rent roll and itemized expenses, then hands that
series to the same returns engine Deal Analyzer uses
(deal_analyzer_math.analyze_noi_series). Pure: no Flask, no database, no
I/O, so every figure here is unit-testable directly.

The division of labour, and why it matters:

    Deal Analyzer   one NOI number in  -> returns out
    Underwriting    rent roll + expense lines -> NOI series -> same engine

Both call the same engine deliberately. Two implementations of IRR would
eventually disagree about the same deal, and the disagreement would be
silent -- the sensitivity grid is computed by that engine too, cell by
cell, for exactly this reason.

Sign convention, stated once because getting it wrong is invisible: every
element of the EGI build-up below GPR is a DEDUCTION and is subtracted.
Other income is the only addition. A T12 may carry deductions as negative
numbers already; this module takes magnitudes and subtracts them, so
callers must pass positive values for losses.

    Income is rebuilt per year (see build_egi_for_year) rather than grown

    mid-hold is expressible. Expenses grow per line, each line falling
    back to its own flat rate and then to the scenario default -- that is
    the point of an itemized model: property tax and insurance rarely move
    at the same rate as payroll.

    `scenario`, `schedule` and `base_egi` are optional together. Without
    them this reproduces the flat-rate path exactly, from the same
    `egi_year1` scalar it always took, so existing callers are unaffected.
    With them, the same arithmetic runs with per-year rates resolved by
    underwriting_schedule -- and when no rate is actually overridden, the
    two agree to the last bit.

    `management_fee_pct` is charged annually as a percentage of that
    year's NET RENTAL INCOME, and is deducted with the other operating
    expenses -- so it reduces NOI, and therefore also the exit value,

    ── What the fee is charged on ───────────────────────────────────────

    Net rental income is what the units bring in after loss to lease,
    vacancy, concessions and bad debt -- and BEFORE other income is added
    back. Parking, laundry, pet fees and any other non-rent revenue are
    excluded from the base entirely.

    Three figures are easy to confuse here, so on Eagle Rock's real rent
    roll, in dollars:

        gross potential rent                    1,343,580.00
        net rental income (the fee basis)       1,150,551.30
        effective gross income                  1,223,671.52

    The fee is charged on the middle one. It is lower than EGI by exactly
    the other income (73,120.22) and lower than gross potential rent by
    the deductions.

    It needs no growth rate of its own: being a percentage of income it
