"""
FIRE Capital Tools - Site DD persistence.

The rebuilt model: an assessment (one site visit), the areas within it,
the rooms within those, the findings recorded against them, and the media
attached to those findings. Summaries are never stored -- they are
computed on read by tools/site_dd_conditions.summarize(), so a stored
figure can never drift out of step with the findings behind it.

Two tables from the first version, site_dd_items and site_dd_photos, are
superseded and left in place rather than dropped. See the comment above
them for why; nothing reads or writes them.

Same connection/schema-init pattern as every other SQLite module here:
env-var-overridable path with a repo-relative fallback, fresh connection
per call, idempotent CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS on every connect.

The database path is controlled by SITE_DD_DB_PATH. In production this
MUST point at the persistent volume (/data/site_dd.db) -- the container
filesystem is ephemeral and the fallback below exists for local
development only.

deal_id is a soft reference to deal_dive.db's deals table -- a plain
nullable integer, since SQLite cannot enforce a foreign key across
database files. Two things keep that safe, exactly as for rent_comps:

  * deals uses AUTOINCREMENT, so a deleted deal's id is never reissued and
    an orphan can never re-attach itself to an unrelated future deal.
  * delete_assessments_for_deal() below is called from Deal Dive's
    delete_deal(), so orphans don't accumulate in the first place.

#
# Every render site was `{{ area.status|title }}` -- the stored value,
# title-cased. That works only while every value is a single lowercase
# word, which is true of these three and is an accident of them being the
# first three. The moment the vocabulary gains a value like
# `vacant_not_ready` -- and it is under discussion, because a unit that is
# vacant and needs a turn is neither `vacant` nor `down` -- the screen
# would read "Vacant_Not_Ready". A stored key leaking into an
# inspector-facing screen is the same class of defect as `not_working`
# appearing in a capital budget, which the work-options fix had to correct
# at the same time it was admitting those findings.
#
# So the map lands first, on its own. It is display-neutral today by
# construction: every label here is byte-identical to what `|title`
# already produced, which a test pins. That makes a later vocabulary
# change a data change, not a data change plus a display fix.
