"""
FIRE Capital Tools - Market data service (RentCast + Google Places).

Looks up an address and pulls:
  - RentCast (real public REST API, sourced from public records/listings --
    not scraping): rent estimate, rental comparables, and basic property
    details.
  - Google Places API (official): rating, review count, a few review
    snippets.

Built standalone -- no dependency on Deal Dive's own blueprint code, same
principle as tools/scorecard_history.py and tools/deal_dive_db.py -- so it
can also become the foundation of the currently-placeholder "Rent Comps"
tool later without redoing this work. Deal Dive (tools/deal_dive.py) is a
*caller* of this module, not the other way around.

RentCast's free tier is 50 calls/month, so every lookup goes through
tools/market_data_cache.py first; a real API call only happens on a cache
miss or a stale (>30 days by default) entry.

Both providers degrade gracefully rather than raising: a missing API key,
a failed request, or an address neither provider recognizes all come back
as {"available": False, "message": ...} instead of an exception, the same
way FIRE Metrics' own market-context lookup in tools/deal_dive.py handles
an unindexed city.
