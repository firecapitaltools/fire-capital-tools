FIRE Capital Tools - Site DD unit and room checklists.

What gets inspected inside a unit: the items common to every room, the
extra items a kitchen or a bathroom needs, and the unit-wide items that
belong to no single room. Pure: no Flask, no database, no I/O.

THREE KINDS OF ITEM, AND WHY

Not everything an inspector records is a condition.

  condition   wear on the five-state scale. Walls, windows, a tub.
  choice      a categorical fact. The flooring is vinyl. The dishwasher
              is a hookup with no machine in it. The smoke alarm is
              missing. These are NOT positions on a wear scale, and
              forcing them onto one would mean recording "Replace" for an
              appliance that was never installed.
  number      a measured quantity with a unit. Water heater capacity in
              gallons, equipment age in years.

A choice item may also carry a condition -- a dishwasher that is present
can still be Good or Replace -- but a dishwasher that is absent has no
condition at all, and the form reflects that.

FLOORING TYPE IS A SEPARATE ITEM FROM FLOORING CONDITION

"Vinyl, Good" and "Carpet, Replace" are two different facts, and a repair
cost cannot be estimated from the condition alone: replacing carpet and
replacing hardwood are not the same line in a budget. So every room
carries both, as two items.

ITEM KEYS REPEAT ACROSS ROOMS ON PURPOSE

`flooring` means the same question in every room. Findings are unique on
(assessment, area, room, item), so the same key in the kitchen and in
bedroom 2 are different rows without needing different names. Namespacing
them would make "show me every floor that needs replacing" a string
-parsing exercise instead of a query.

#
# Aligned to how site_dd_checklist already categorises the equivalent
# property-scope item, so the two scopes agree rather than each inventing
# its own grouping:
#
#   windows_doors     -> structural_envelope   so: windows
#   alarms_detectors  -> life_safety           so: smoke / CO alarms
#   egress_signage    -> life_safety           so: egress window
#   hvac_units        -> mep                   so: hvac, hvac_age
#   water_heaters     -> mep                   so: water_heater*
#   electrical_panels -> mep                   so: outlets, lighting, GFCI
#   plumbing_supply   -> mep                   so: fixtures
#   ventilation       -> mep                   so: exhaust fan, dryer vent
#   flooring          -> interior_units
#   walls_ceilings    -> interior_units
#   unit_appliances   -> interior_units        so: every appliance_*
#
# The one judgement not read straight off that list is the fixture/finish
# split inside kitchens and bathrooms. The rule is "who does the work":
# a plumber or electrician (mep), or a contractor doing finishes and
# cabinetry (interior_units). So tub, toilet, sink and faucet are mep;
# cabinets, countertops, flooring and closets are interior_units.
#
# A key absent from this table gets None, which to_capex_lines() reports
# as an uncategorised line. That is the honest outcome for an item nobody
# has classified, and better than a catch-all bucket that looks like a
# decision.

# ── SCOPE DETAILS: which job, on an item whose condition says there is one ──
#
# The second population of `detail`, and the first on condition items.
# `detail` has always held a PRESENCE fact on choice items -- what is it,
# is it there. These hold a SCOPE fact: the condition already says the
# thing needs work, and this says which work.
#
# WHY THE TWO CANNOT COLLIDE
#
# No item key writes `detail` under two meanings. Choice items write
# presence; these six condition items write scope; number items write
# neither; and the property checklist never writes `detail` at all --
# `save()` writes twelve keys and that is not one of them. See
# docs/site-dd-detail-values.md section 1, whose original claim ("an item
# key is KIND_CHOICE or KIND_CONDITION, never both") was too strong and is
# corrected there: pest_evidence is both, and is harmless for exactly that
# reason.
#
# NO VALUE HERE IS "repair" OR "replace", DELIBERATELY
#
# needs_work() rule 3 returns True for a `detail` that is itself a work
# condition string. That rule exists because ALARM_STATES carries the
# literal value `replace` and the old filter read the wrong column. A
# scope detail must not trip it: it says WHICH job, never WHETHER there is
# one, and whether there is one is the condition's answer alone. So the
# keys are `repair_door`, not `repair`.
#
# Every set below is registered in WORK_OPTIONS with an EMPTY frozenset,
# for the same reason FLOORING_TYPES and PEST_TYPE are: "considered, and
# no value here implies work" is a different statement from "nobody
# looked", and test_work_options.py requires the entry either way.

# Paresh's `closet_condition`. Three jobs, three prices, one condition
# word -- which is why `closet` is in UNPRICED with "no source separates
# them". This is the thing that was missing, not a price.

# condition scale so the rollup and completion percentage still work.
# Where a thing is present or not, it is a choice -- the distinction this

# "missing" is not a position on a wear scale.

# NOTE ON GFCI, WHICH IS ALREADY HERE
#
# It was on the "missing from our checklist" list and it should not have
# been: gfci already exists as a kitchen and bathroom item, scoped to the
# wet areas where the protection is actually required. Paresh's form asks
# it once per unit; per wet room is the better question and we already
# ask it.
#
# The real difference his form exposed -- ours recorded presence, his
# recorded whether the outlet TRIPS -- is closed: GFCI_STATES above
# carries `not_working`, "Present, not working", which is the dangerous
# case neither set caught alone. It did NOT need to be a `detail`
# question on top of a condition, as an earlier note here claimed; it is
# a third option value on a choice item, which is what the item already
# was.


# ── Which option values mean work is needed ──────────────────────────────
#
# WORK_CONDITIONS says which positions on the WEAR SCALE cost money. This
# is the same statement for choice items, and it is deliberately the same
# shape: declared once, beside the thing it describes, in the module that
# owns it. It is NOT a per-item map, because a per-item map is twenty-one
# entries that each have to be remembered when an item is added, and
# forgetting one is exactly how a missing smoke alarm stopped reaching a
# capital budget.
#
# IT CANNOT BE A GLOBAL SET OF VALUES, AND THAT IS NOT A STYLE CHOICE
#
# Two values mean OPPOSITE things depending on which set they belong to:
#
#   present   work on `mold` (there is mold), no work on the eight
#             PRESENCE appliances (the appliance is there)
#   none      work on `egress_window` ("No egress window"), no work on
#             `mold`, `pest_evidence` and `visible_leaks` ("None seen")
#
# So WORK_OPTIONS = {"missing", "absent", "present", ...} would be wrong
# on at least four items. The set a value belongs to is what gives it its
# meaning, so the set is what carries the answer.
#
# Keyed by the option tuple itself. Tuples hash by value, so every item
# sharing a set inherits one answer and cannot drift from its siblings --
# PRESENCE alone covers eight appliances plus two bank items.
#
# ALARM_STATES and EQUIPMENT_STATES are EQUAL TUPLES, so they collapse to
# one entry here. That is correct today -- working/missing/replace means
# the same for an alarm and for a water heater -- but it means the two
# can never be given different answers while their values match. If they
# ever need to differ, they have to stop being equal first.
#
# A set that is absent from this table is a FAILURE, not a default of "no
# work": tests/test_work_options.py requires every option set reachable
# from the catalogue or the bank to appear here. Silence is how the last

    """True when this finding records something that costs money.

    THE ONE DEFINITION. site_dd.capex_export() filters on this, and the
    capture screen opens its cost box on it, so the form and the budget
    cannot disagree about what counts -- which is the disagreement that
    produced the gap this function closes.

    Three ways a finding can be work, in order:

    1. Its CONDITION is repair or replace. Unchanged, and the only rule
       there was before this.
    2. Its DETAIL is a work-implying value for this item's option set.
       A missing smoke alarm, a dead GFCI, a range that is not there.
    3. Its DETAIL is itself a work condition string.

    Rule 3 is belt and braces and it earns its place. ALARM_STATES
    carries the literal value `replace` -- a string that IS in
    WORK_CONDITIONS -- in the `detail` column, and the old filter read
    `condition`, so "Needs replacing" on a smoke alarm was discarded by a
    filter that would have admitted the identical string one column over.
    Rule 2 already catches that particular case; rule 3 means no future
    option set can reintroduce it by being added and not registered.
    Checked: no option set anywhere uses `repair` or `replace` to mean
    anything other than work, so this cannot fire wrongly.

    `item` may be None -- a stale key from an older checklist, or a
    property-scope finding whose catalogue lives elsewhere. Then only
    rules 1 and 3 apply, which is the same tolerance is_known_item()
    already gives an unrecognised key: ignore what cannot be resolved

    `findings_by_room` maps room_id -> {item_key: [condition per instance]}.
    Counts come from tools/site_dd_conditions, so a unit summary and the
    property summary are produced by the same code and cannot drift apart.

    Instances count independently, and the denominator counts them too --
    see site_dd_conditions.summarize for why dividing by the catalogue
    size stops being right once an item can occur twice.

    Only conditions are counted. A choice like "Hookup only" is a fact
    about the unit, not a rating, and totalling it alongside wear states
    would produce a number that means nothing.

    ADDED ITEMS COUNT LIKE ANY OTHER

    `added_by_room` and `added_unit` carry the item-bank picks and the
    freeform entries recorded on this unit, already shaped like checklist
    items. They are passed in rather than inferred from unrecognised keys
    in the answers, so the tolerance that lets a stale key from an older
    checklist be ignored is preserved -- an unknown key is still skipped,
    and an added item is counted because the caller said it exists.

    A fireplace added to a living room raises the denominator by one, the
    same way a second sink does. Adding something and then never
    assessing it should make the unit look less complete, because it is.
