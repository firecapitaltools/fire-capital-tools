"""
FIRE Capital Tools - Site DD (beta).

A structured site walkthrough: a 32-item inspection checklist across six
categories, each recorded on the five-state condition scale
(Excellent/Good/Satisfactory/Repair/Replace), rolled up into counts by
state and a count of what needs work, with per-item notes,
photos, and a PDF report.

Supersedes Deal Dive's Condition tab, which was a single subjective rating
plus a notes blob plus a file list -- the same question this asks, at a
depth that cannot carry an inspection. Deal Dive keeps a summary card
linking here, the same way it does for Rent Comps.

Two modes, deal-linked primary:
  * Deal-linked -- arrived at with ?deal_id=N from Deal Dive's card. A site
    visit is nearly always tied to a property being pursued.
  * Standalone -- a walkthrough of something not (yet) in Deal Dive, which
    requires a property_label; an inspection record with no property
    identity is useless.

Unlike Rent Comps, nothing here is locked in deal-linked mode: the
inspection date and inspector belong to the visit, not to the deal
record, and follow the Deal Analyzer precedent of prefill-but-editable.

Scores are never stored -- they are computed on read from the item rows by
site_dd_conditions.summarize(), so what the screen shows, what the
summary card shows, and what the PDF prints cannot drift apart.

    What they DO share, exactly, is how a single field should be read --

    remembering the rule.
