"""
FIRE Capital Tools - Rent Comps.

A standalone rental-comparables lookup: enter any address, pull RentCast's
rent estimate and comparable rentals, and save the ones worth keeping.

Two modes, one page:
  * Standalone -- type an address, saved comps have a NULL deal_id and
    belong to no deal. This is the Markets-section use case: checking a
    submarket without a deal existing yet.
  * Deal-scoped -- arrived at with ?deal_id=N from Deal Dive. The address
    is taken from the deal (read-only, since editing it here would silently
    diverge from the deal record), and saved comps carry that deal_id so
    Deal Dive can show a count and link back.

Reuses tools/market_data_service for every RentCast interaction -- that
module was built standalone for exactly this, and none of its
API-calling or caching logic is duplicated here. Quota safety is the same
pattern Deal Dive uses, calling the same market_data_service.rentcast_quota()
so there is one definition of "at cap" across both tools:
  * Reload from Cache -- always free, never touches the network.
  * Force Refresh -- spends a call, confirmed in the UI, refused both
    client-side (disabled button) and server-side once at cap.
