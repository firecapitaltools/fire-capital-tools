"""
FIRE Capital Tools - synthesising transcripts into an investor update.

Prompt construction, response parsing and the cache key. The OpenAI call
itself is one small function at the bottom; everything above it is pure
and testable without a network or a key.

THIS IS MULTI-DOCUMENT SYNTHESIS, NOT SUMMARISATION

Several meetings, each contributing to different sections. A quarter's
operations discussion might be spread over three calls and a capital
item mentioned once in passing. So the model is given every transcript
with an explicit id and date, and asked to place claims under headings
while naming which meeting each came from.

EVERY CLAIM CARRIES ITS SOURCE

Each bullet records the transcript it came from. Michelle should be able
to point at any sentence in an update and get to the meeting and date
behind it -- and if she cannot, the sentence should not be there.
parse_response drops any bullet whose source id is not in the set that
was actually sent, so the model cannot attribute a claim to a meeting
that was not part of the query.

AN EMPTY SECTION SAYS SO

Padding a section nobody discussed is how a document stops being worth
reading. A section with no source material renders as an explicit "not
discussed in these meetings" rather than a plausible paragraph.

FINANCIAL FIGURES ARE NARRATIVE AND GO NOWHERE

A number said on a call is hearsay relative to the underwriting model.
The financial section is prose only; nothing here writes to Underwriting,
Deal Dive or any other tool, and no caller is given a machine-readable
figure to write with. Where a transcript states a number the model also
holds, the page shows both and flags the difference -- see
compare_with_model.
