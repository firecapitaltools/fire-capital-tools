"""
FIRE Capital Tools - Investor Report notetaker.

Upload meeting transcripts, match each to a property, filter by date
range, and synthesise the matched set into a structured investor update.

WHY THE DATE IS TYPED IN AND NOT PARSED

Fathom and Otter both put a date in their exports, but not in a shape
this app can rely on: it varies by export format (txt, docx, pdf, and
Fathom's "copy transcript" clipboard form), by the user's locale, and by
whether the meeting title happens to contain a different date. A parser
that is right most of the time silently files a meeting under the wrong
quarter, which is exactly the error that would survive review -- an
investor update covering the wrong period looks completely normal.

So the date is entered once at upload, next to the file, where the
person who exported it is looking at it. If a reliable parse is
confirmed later it becomes a PREFILL for this field, never a
replacement.

WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO

Nothing here writes to Underwriting, Deal Dive, Site DD or Rent Comps.
A figure stated on a call is what somebody said; a figure in the model
is what was underwritten. The update shows both and flags a divergence,
and there is no code path that resolves one into the other.

    THE GAP THIS CLOSES

    A property becomes visible to the notetaker by having a record in
    Deal Dive, Underwriting or Site DD -- those three are the only
    sources investor_notes_properties.build() reads. Michelle has
    meetings about properties before any of those exist, and until one
    does there is nothing to attach an alias to and every transcript
    naming the property comes back unassigned. That is not a matching
    problem and no amount of alias work fixes it.

    So this writes the smallest real record rather than inventing a
    fourth kind of property. An Underwriting scenario needs exactly one
    thing, property_label, and everything else is nullable -- so a stub
    is a scenario with a name and no numbers. It gets its key from
    absorb() like every other scenario, appears in the alias list
    immediately, and the day somebody underwrites it they open the
    scenario already sitting there and start typing.

    The alternative -- letting an alias exist on its own -- would create
    a property visible in one tool and unreachable from every other, and
    would then collide with the real record the moment one was made.
