"""
FIRE Capital Tools - Admin.

Operational reference pages that aren't deal-workflow tools. Currently
just API & Service Costs; the blueprint exists as a section rather than a
one-off route so the next operational page has somewhere obvious to go
instead of being wedged into Acquisitions or Markets.

Read-only. No writes, no forms beyond the shared feedback component --
so no new storage path and no env var to verify, unlike every tool built
this cycle. The feedback page reads an existing database; it does not
own one.
