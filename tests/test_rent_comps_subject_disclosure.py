"""What RentCast decided the subject is, said on the page.

WHY THIS EXISTS

RentCast's rent endpoint resolves an address to ONE unit and returns
comparables matched to that unit's size. On a multi-unit building it
picks one. 1029 S Jackson St came back as a studio, 433 sqft, and all
fifteen comparables came back studios.

Two consequences were invisible on this page:

  * The bedroom filter appears to do nothing, because every row is
    already that size. A tester hit exactly this and reported the control
    as broken. It is not -- both selects are client-side and wired
    identically; there was simply nothing to filter out.
  * The rent estimate is an estimate FOR THAT SIZE. Apex View resolved to
    a 1-bed and returned $1,010, which is a correct number about a
    possibly wrong apartment.

The fix is disclosure, not correction. Correcting it means re-requesting
against a chosen size or fetching the building's floorplans, and both
spend RentCast quota against a 50/month cap. Those are Michelle's calls.

THE STUDIO BUG THIS ALSO CLOSES

`{{ bedrooms or '—' }}` swallows a studio, because 0 is falsy. A real
studio rendered identically to "RentCast told us nothing" -- on the exact
address the tester was looking at.
