"""A rule stated twice must not lose its condition in the shorter statement.

WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY IS NOT

It is a **regression guard over named rules**, not a discovery instrument.
It cannot find a new two-statement drift; it can only stop a registered one
from being re-stripped. That limitation is chosen, and the measurements
behind the choice are recorded below so nobody re-runs the experiment.

THE DISCOVERY VERSION WAS BUILT, MEASURED, AND REFUSED

Three designs were tried against a HANDOFF known to be correct. The
question each had to answer: "which rules are stated in two places, with a
condition in one and not the other?"

  v1  cluster on the content words INSIDE each imperative.
      FAILED ITS POSITIVE CONTROL. Restoring the real pre-Part-41 text --
      "Do not start the Entrata parser seam" against "Do not scope it
      until a sample exists" -- produced ZERO pairs, because the long form
      says "it". The topic is in the surrounding sentence, never in the
      verb phrase. An instrument that misses the one case it was built for
      is not a strict instrument, it is a broken one.

  v2  discover topics from capitalised nouns and backticked identifiers.
      2 flags on a correct file, both false: markdown split mid-statement,
      and the new HANDOFF section that QUOTES stripped rules as examples.

  v3  join paragraphs, strip quoted spans. 3 flags on a correct file, all
      false -- generic topic words ("Site", "Closed") grouping unrelated
      statements, and bullet lists joined into one unit.

  100% false positives on every design that could discover anything.

THE ROOT CAUSE IS LINGUISTIC, NOT A TUNING PROBLEM

Measured: of 16 uses of "never" in HANDOFF, **13 are descriptive** --
"never shipped", "never exercised", "the rate bug never touched equity".
Only 3 are prescriptive. Telling a rule from a sentence about the past is
a natural-language judgment, and a regex that tries it flags prose.

The dead-reader glob was measured at 81 hits / 54 framework routes and
refused on the same grounds; the noisy half is refused here and the narrow
half kept, which is the same trade.

So: the convention is the real protection --

    when writing a rule in a summary, carry its condition or link the
    full statement

-- and this file holds the line only for rules already known to have
drifted. Adding a topic here is cheap; discovering one is human work.

# ONE SECTION IS EXCLUDED, WITH A REASON, AND THE EXCLUSION SELF-CHECKS
#
# HANDOFF now contains a section that documents this very failure, and it
# does so by NAMING the rules that drifted and quoting what they used to
# say. Prose about a prohibition is lexically a prohibition: "the extra
# scope forbids something valuable ... separates these three from
# normalize_address_key and Entrata" matches on both the topic and the
# verb, and it is not a rule at all.
#
# Stripping quotations handles the quoted half; it cannot handle a sentence
# that merely discusses the rule. That is a natural-language judgment, so
# the section is excluded by name rather than by a cleverer pattern, and
# test_the_excluded_section_still_exists fails if it is renamed -- the same
# stale-entry self-check both reachability sweeps carry.

}

# WHY ONLY ONE RULE IS REGISTERED, THOUGH TWO WERE NARROWED
#
# Entrata's qualifier is a CONDITION -- "until a real sample export exists"
# -- and condition words are a closed lexical class, so its absence is
# mechanically detectable. The positive control fires precisely on it.
#
# Scraping's qualifier is a DOMAIN -- which sites it covers, and that
# licensed APIs are exempt -- and that is NOT mechanically detectable.
# Measured, not assumed: the original bare rule read "Michelle explicitly
# does not want scraping; reference costs are a one-time manual research
# pass", which contains "reference cost". Every domain-shaped pattern loose
# enough to accept the narrowed rule's own paragraphs also accepts that
# original, and every pattern tight enough to reject the original (requiring
# the licensed-API exemption) rejects narrowed paragraphs that are perfectly
# well scoped. Its positive control could not be made to fire without
# tuning the pattern until the two known strings happened to land right --
# which is fitting the instrument to its test cases, and would have shipped
# a check that certifies nothing.
#
# So scraping is deliberately NOT registered. Judging whether a domain is
# adequately stated is a semantic judgment and stays with the reader.
# The convention in HANDOFF covers it; this file covers what a regex can
# honestly decide.
