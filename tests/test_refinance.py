"""
Cash-out refinance: a capital event in the middle of a hold.

Everything before this was operating cash flow and a terminal sale. A
refinance is the first mid-hold event that hands money to investors, and
it does three things at once: it replaces the loan, it returns capital,
and it changes what the preferred return accrues on for every period
afterwards.

MICHELLE'S ORDER, WHICH IS THE PART THAT MATTERS

    payoff of the old loan -> fees -> return of capital

Preferred return is deliberately absent. It is not paid at the event; it
keeps accruing afterwards on whatever capital is still unreturned. That
is the whole point of returning capital early, and it is why the tests
below check the accrual in the year AFTER the refinance rather than only
the dollars moved at it.

THE FEE BASE IS AN ASSUMPTION AND IS FLAGGED AS ONE

refi_fee_pct is charged on the excess proceeds pool, not on the gross new
loan. The stated order forces that reading -- the fee sits between the
payoff and the return of capital, so it can only be a share of what
survives the payoff. The sale-side capital transaction fee uses the gross
sale price instead, so the two bases genuinely differ. If that is wrong,
one line in refinance() changes and these tests say which.

    WHY assertIsNot(passed, False) WAS NOT ENOUGH

    check_invariants() and verify_against_source() report each invariant as
    a dict with "passed" set to True, False, or None. None means the
    invariant did not apply to this run -- invariant 10 returns it when the
    property failed to cover a shortfall, because the LP and property
    vectors cannot match by design in that case.

    `assertIsNot(passed, False)` therefore accepts None as success. An
    invariant that silently stopped evaluating -- because a key was renamed,
    a guard inverted, or a branch stopped being reached -- would report None
    and the assertion would still go green. The suite would claim invariant
    coverage it did not have.
