"""The disclosure states what the comparables actually are.

WHAT WAS WRONG, AND HOW IT GOT SHIPPED

The first version asserted, unconditionally, that "the comparables below
are matched to that size -- which is why changing the bedroom filter may
not change the rows."

That was inferred from four cached addresses where it happened to hold,
and it is false on three of the seven we have:

    1029 s jackson st        subject 0bd   15 of 15 same size   holds
    11602 apex view dr       subject 1bd   15 of 15 same size   holds
    19 bay vista drive       subject 4bd   15 of 15 same size   holds
    480 warren dr            subject 0bd   15 of 15 same size   holds
    5208 11th street lubbock subject 1bd    2 of 15 same size   FALSE
    598 belvedere            subject 5bd    3 of 15 same size   FALSE
    598 belvedere street     subject 5bd    3 of 15 same size   FALSE

On Lubbock the page told the reader the comparables were matched to a
1-bed when two of fifteen were, and told them the filter would not change
the rows when it changes thirteen of them.

This was written one step after flagging the identical error in Scorecard
Pro's warnings card, which asserts "this file does not state Gross
Potential Rent" when what the code knows is that nothing matched account
4110. Same failure: a cause inferred while writing, from a sample that
agreed.

THE RULE THESE TESTS ENFORCE

The page may only state what it can count. Composition is computed from
the comparables actually rendered, and the three cases -- all, none, some
-- are asserted against the real cached shapes rather than a
representative one. The sample agreeing is precisely how this shipped.
