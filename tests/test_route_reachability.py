"""Every GET route a person is meant to reach must be linked from a template.

THE COMPANION TO test_dead_readers.py

That file catches a reader nothing calls. This one catches a page nothing
links to. They are the same bug at two different layers, and this app has
now produced it four times:

    feedback_db.list_feedback()   a reader with no caller
    notes_db.list_updates()       a reader with no caller
    the notetaker                 a page with no way in
    site_dd.capex_budget          a finished PDF and Excel export,
                                  routed, correct, and linked from
                                  nowhere at all

The last one is why this file exists. Michelle asked for an Excel export
of the Site DD assessment. It had been shipped, working, for weeks. She
could not find it, so she asked for it -- which is what a discoverability
bug sounds like from the outside.

WHAT COUNTS AS REFERENCED

A url_for('endpoint') in any template, OR -- for a route with no dynamic
segments -- its literal path in a template. The second clause matters: an
earlier version of this sweep matched url_for only and reported
/manifest.json and /service-worker.js as unreachable, when base.html
links the first as href="/manifest.json" and registers the second from
JavaScript. Two false positives in the first six results is how a
checker teaches people to ignore it.

WHAT IT STRUCTURALLY CANNOT SEE, STATED PLAINLY

  A SELF-REFERENTIAL CLUSTER. If a group of pages link only to each
  other, every one of them looks referenced while the group as a whole
  has no way in. That is exactly what the notetaker was: its own pages
  carried "back to Meeting Notes" links, so this sweep does NOT flag it
  at the commit before the nav entry was added. Verified, not assumed.

  NavShellTests below is the narrow answer to that specific hole: every
  blueprint's index must be linked from base.html, which is the one
  template reachable from everywhere. It would have caught the notetaker.
  It does not generalise to deep pages, and nothing here pretends it does.

  A link built by string concatenation in JavaScript, or an endpoint
  reached only by a redirect from another endpoint.

WHAT IT EXCLUDES BY DESIGN

  POST-only routes -- they are form targets, not destinations.
  The static endpoint.
  Anything on ALLOWLIST, each with a written reason. "Nobody has linked
  it yet" is not a reason; that is the bug.
